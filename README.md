# DESCRIPTION 
1.Get the API Key from OpenWeatherMap: Sign up on OpenWeatherMap at OpenWeatherMap API. Obtain an API key after logging in. 
2.Create the Webpage: HTML for structure. CSS for styling and responsiveness. JavaScript to fetch and display weather data dynamically. Key Features: Responsive Layout: The page automatically adjusts its layout depending on the screen size. On mobile devices, the input field and button become more compact. Dynamic Content Loading: Weather data is fetched dynamically and displayed without reloading the page. This is done using the JavaScript fetch() function. Error Handling: If the user inputs an invalid city or there’s an issue with the API call, an error message is shown. This improves the user experience by providing feedback. How It Works: User Interface (UI): The page has a simple search bar where users can enter the name of a city and click on the "Get Weather" button. The weather information will be dynamically displayed below the search bar. API Integration (OpenWeatherMap): The JavaScript function getWeather() is called when the user clicks the button. It fetches the weather data for the city entered by the user using the OpenWeatherMap API. The API key is included in the request URL. Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API key obtained from OpenWeatherMap. Keywords and Concepts API Key:
